    <h2>CLASS DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>This is a studio-based course that introduces students to computer programming with an
    emphasis on using creative practices to formulate new ideas. No previous programming
    experience is required. Students will learn techniques to generate compelling data-driven visual
    projects that can engage the physical world. Through readings and discussions, the course will
    also explore ideas about the ways in which computation has augmented how we make meaning
    from our visual environment. Composing a series of projects throughout the semester, students
    will experiment and develop their own strategies to creatively write code. Students will complete
    the class with a foundation of technical skills to pursue individual learning of more advanced
    programming, scripting, and web development. There are no prerequisites for this course.</p>
    <p>The class will be taught as a series of lectures, discussions, tutorials, project work, and student
    critiques.</p>

    <p><b>*Note: Students are required to have a device that enables internet browsing and
        downloading large files.</b></p>

    <h2>LEARNING OBJECTIVES</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Acquire a vocabulary to unpack programming concepts and techniques with confidence.</li>
        <li>Critically examining how new media art is entangled in histories of culture and technology.</li>
        <li>Develop idiosyncratic processes to facilitate creatively engaging with computation.</li>
        <li>Produce a series of works from exercises to longer-term projects.</li>
        <li>Productively discuss and critique peers’ work.</li>
        <li>Connect technical skills to critical thinking to create meaningful artistic compositions.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>ATTENDANCE + ONLINE PROCEDURES</h2>
    <p>We will meet on Zoom at the beginning of the semester and in person beginning at the end of
        September. The class will be taught synchronously. We will be using Github to share our
        projects with the class. If you are in a timezone that could hamper your ability to participate at
        the scheduled time contact me and we can work out the best options to pursue. You are
        welcome to join in the online meetings from your mobile phone however, screen sharing from
        the device you build your projects on is the best way to get help/feedback on your projects.</p>

    <h2>COURSE MATERIALS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Students need to have access to a laptop with an internet connection outside of the
            classroom in order to be able to complete assignments. Any operating system is acceptable and
            modifications or accommodations will be provided if there’s an assignment that isn’t compatible
            with yours.</li>
        <li>The zoom link can be found on blackboard</li>
        <li>even during in person classes, I'll use zoom to record and post the classes incase you want to reference them later</li>
        <li>readings will be posted under the assignment tab in the course website and on blackboard</li>

    <h2>GRADING</h2>
    <p>Grading will take place through a series of critiques. A format typically used in art programs that
        follow the format of an individual or group presentation of each project. After a brief presentation
        and demo of the project, the class offers their thoughts on the work. This format is used
        because it helps the class as a group develop a language to discuss artwork and articulate
        nuance while also allowing the presenting student to help develop the rubric under which they
        want their project discussed. It is a standard format in art and design courses and is designed to
        help students develop and relate critical decision-making to the execution of their projects.</p>
    <h3>GRADING KEY</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>A</b> = outstanding accomplishment in all assignments (technically and conceptually), excellent engagement with
            ideas and materials, excellent participation in classroom community (vocal, inquisitive, and ALWAYS thoughtful),

            engagement with ideas and materials, lack of participation in classroom community, failure to arrive prepared for
            class routinely, irregular attendance, little or no evidence of progress</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Attendance</h2>
    <p>Attendance is required. Students are expected to attend all classes and be present for the full duration of each.
        Announcements and directions will be given at the beginning of class and it is important that you arrive on time.
        Absences, late arrivals, and leaving class early will reflect negatively on your grade. Communicate with your
        instructors if there are serious or extenuating circumstances that prevent you from arriving on time, or from
        attendance with full participation. Be prepared to present a doctor’s note if absence is due to illness.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Maximum: two unexcused absences for the semester.</li>
        <li>Three unexcused absences = your grade will drop by one letter grade.</li>
        <li>One letter grade will be dropped for each additional unexcused absence.</li>
        <li>Five or more unexcused absences = automatic failure of the course.</li>
        <li>Missing class on scheduled presentation / critique days is equivalent to missing (i.e., failing an exam).</li>
        <li>Three late arrivals or early departures will count as one absence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cell phones and other digital communications</h2>
       <p> During class time, it is not appropriate to make or receive phone calls, monitor or send text or e-mail messages, or use the
        internet for purposes unrelated to course content. “Mental absence” due to such distractions will be counted as missed
        class time, will be counted as absences, and will contribute to lowering your grade.</p>

    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <p>Assignments are always due on the day they are DUE. Late work is not acceptable because often in-class activities are
        closely tied to sharing and discussing assignments. Late work undermines your own learning as well as that of the learning
        community.</p>

    <h2>Accommodation for Disabilities</h2>
    <p>Guided by the belief that people with disabilities are assets to the University, UIC is committed to full inclusion and
        participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of University life. We seek to provide an academic, social, and
        physical environment that makes disabled people integral to the diversity of perspectives that is vital to an academic
        community.</br></br>

        UIC supports the principles of universally accessible design, alternative communication formats, and the expression of
        disability community and pride. At all levels of the University, UIC promotes equal opportunity, fair treatment, and the
        elimination of barriers for qualified individuals with disabilities.
        Students with disabilities who require accommodations for full access and participation in UIC Programs must be
        registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Please contact DRC at (312) 413-2183 (voice) or (312) 413-
        0123 (TDD).</br></br>
        ***During the first week of the semester*** a student who has a letter of accommodation (LOA) for any type of
        disability MUST schedule a meeting with their instructor(s) in order to discuss + confirm a plan for implementing
        accommodations.</p>

    <h2>Religious Holiday Observance Policy</h2>
    <p>In accordance with Illinois state laws and with respect for cultural diversity, we will make every effort to avoid scheduling
        examinations or requiring student projects be turned in or completed on religious holidays. Students who wish to observe
        their religious holidays must notify the instructor by the tenth day of the term that they will be absent unless their religious
        holiday is observed on or before the tenth day, in such case students must notify instructor at least five days in advance of
        the date when he or she will be absent.</p>

    <h2>Safe Space</h2>
    <p>The UIC School of Art & Art History is committed to creating a safe space in our classrooms that is a welcoming,
        supportive, and safe environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) students.</p>

    <h2>Image Reproduction</h2>
    <p>Projects created in this course may be used for educational purposes, including instruction in future courses and
        promotion of the School, College or University. If you have concerns about sharing or distributing any of your work for
        these purposes, please discuss with your instructor.</p>

    <h2>Cheating</h2>
    <p>In accordance with UIC policies, any student caught plagiarizing a paper, any visual material without giving
        appropriate credit or copying homework will 1) Fail the assignment 2) Be subject to removal from and failure of the
        course 3) Be reported to the Dean of Students for possible removal from the University.</p>

    <h2>Student Disciplinary Policy</h2>
    <p>The Student Disciplinary Policy is the University's process to handle allegations of misconduct by UIC Students.
        The Student Disciplinary Policy addresses both academic misconduct (such as plagiarism, cheating, or grade
        tampering) and behavioral misconduct (such as theft, assault, under-age drinking, and drug-use.) The main
        purpose of the Student Disciplinary Policy is to ensure that students receive due process - which means that every
        student should have a fair opportunity to express their side of the story before any decisions are made about their
        disciplinary case. The Student Disciplinary Policy was designed to be educational in nature.</p>
